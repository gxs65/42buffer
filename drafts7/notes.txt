# About JS

- structural typing : two objects sharing the same structure are of the same type, even if not defined that way originally
	(-> one can be assigned to the other, etc)
- interfaces are tools used for code clarity only, they disappear at compilation (replaced by complete object structure description)
	and thus they do not exist at runtime, at runtime there exists no reference to interface / other metadata in objects

# About TS

- only compile-time, including interfaces

# About Node.JS

- what it is and means
- how imports work, ES and CommonJS

# About WS

- bidirectional maintained communication protocol
- used stringified objects, define those objects with interfaces, role of discriminated unions

# About project

- explain different server message types and the ways to end a game
- clarifier player/client et gestion du websocket par Websocketserver et ses instances de Pong_game
- bien distinguer ticks de simulation / ticks de broadcast / frames de browser
